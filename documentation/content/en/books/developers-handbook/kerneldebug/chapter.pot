"device (the recommended way to extract a kernel dump) or `AUTO` to use the "
"first configured swap device. The default for `dumpdev` is `AUTO` in HEAD, "
"and changed to `NO` on RELENG_* branches (except for RELENG_7, which was "
"left set to `AUTO`). On FreeBSD 9.0-RELEASE and later versions, bsdinstall "

"`options DDB`: compile in support for the console debugger, DDB. This "
"interactive debugger runs on whatever the active low-level console of the "
"system is, which includes the video console, serial console, or firewire "
"console. It provides basic integrated debugging facilities, such as stack "
"tracing, process and thread listing, dumping of lock state, VM state, file "
"system state, and kernel memory management. DDB does not require software "
"running on a second machine or being able to generate a core dump or full "
"debugging kernel symbols, and provides detailed diagnostics of the kernel at "
"run-time. Many bugs can be fully diagnosed using only DDB output. This "
"option depends on `options KDB`."

"kernel state is more awkward to access than in DDB, which is able to "
"generate useful summaries of kernel state automatically, such as "
"automatically walking lock debugging or kernel memory management structures, "
"and a second machine running the debugger is required. On the other hand, "
"GDB combines information from the kernel source and full debugging symbols, "
"and is aware of full data structure definitions, local variables, and is "
"scriptable. This option is not required to run GDB on a kernel core "

"serial console is significantly more reliable at getting into the debugger, "

"data structures and the invariants of kernel algorithms. These tests can be "
"expensive, so are not compiled in by default, but help provide useful \"fail "
"stop\" behavior, in which certain classes of undesired behavior enter the "
"debugger before kernel data corruption occurs, making them easier to "
"debug. Tests include memory scrubbing and use-after-free testing, which is "
