"One of the easiest ways to learn about updates that have already been "
"committed is by subscribing to http://www.FreshPorts.org/[FreshPorts]. "
"Multiple ports can be monitored. Maintainers are strongly encouraged to "
"subscribe, because they will receive notification of not only their own "
"changes, but also any changes that any other FreeBSD committer has made. "
"(These are often necessary to keep up with changes in the underlying ports "
"framework-although it would be most polite to receive an advance heads-up "
"from those committing such changes, sometimes this is overlooked or "
"impractical. Also, in some cases, the changes are very minor in nature. We "
"expect everyone to use their best judgement in these cases.)"
