"File systems are an integral part of any operating system. They allow users "
"to upload and store files, provide access to data, and make hard drives "
"useful. Different operating systems differ in their native file "
"system. Traditionally, the native FreeBSD file system has been the Unix File "
"System UFS which has been modernized as UFS2. Since FreeBSD 7.0, the Z File "
"System (ZFS) is also available as a native file system. See "
"crossref:zfs[zfs,The Z File System (ZFS)] for more information."

"In addition to its native file systems, FreeBSD supports a multitude of "
"other file systems so that data from other operating systems can be accessed "
"locally, such as data stored on locally attached USB storage devices, flash "

"System (EXT)."
