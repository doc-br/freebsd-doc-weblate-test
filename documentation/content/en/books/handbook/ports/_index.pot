"The `Quarterly` branch provides users with a more predictable and stable "
"experience for port and package installation and upgrades. This is done "
"essentially by only allowing non-feature updates. Quarterly branches aim to "
"receive security fixes (that may be version updates, or backports of "
"commits), bug fixes and ports compliance or framework changes. The Quarterly "
"branch is cut from HEAD at the beginning of every (yearly) quarter in "
"January, April, July, and October. Branches are named according to the year "
"(YYYY) and quarter (Q1-4) they are created in. For example, the quarterly "
"branch created in January 2016, is named 2016Q1. And the `Latest` branch "
"provides the latest versions of the packages to the users."

"Poudriere is a `BSD`-licensed utility for creating and testing FreeBSD "

"FreeBSD that are different from the system on which it is installed, and "
"also to build packages for i386 if the host is an amd64 system. Once the "
"packages are built, they are in a layout identical to the official "
