msgid ""
"The easiest way to handle leap seconds is with the POSIX time rules FreeBSD "
"uses by default, combined with link:{handbook}#network-ntp[NTP]. When "
"man:ntpd[8] is running and the time is synchronized with upstream NTP "
"servers that handle leap seconds correctly, the leap second will cause the "
"system time to automatically repeat the last second of the day. No other "
"adjustments are necessary."

#: documentation/content/en/articles/leap-seconds/_index.adoc:39
msgid ""
"If the upstream NTP servers do not handle leap seconds correctly, "
"man:ntpd[8] will step the time by one second after the errant upstream "
"server has noticed and stepped itself."

"Leap seconds are inserted at the same instant all over the world: UTC "
"midnight. In Japan that is mid-morning, in the Pacific mid-day, in the "
"Americas late afternoon, and in Europe at night."

"We believe and expect that FreeBSD, if provided correct and stable NTP "

"previous ones."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: documentation/content/en/articles/leap-seconds/_index.adoc:50
msgid ""
"However, we caution that practically no applications have ever asked the "
"kernel about leap seconds. Our experience is that, as designed, leap seconds "
"are essentially a replay of the second before the leap second, and this is a "
"surprise to most application programmers."

"It is possible to test whether a leap second will be used. Due to the nature "

"major reference clock sources only announce leap seconds one hour ahead of "
