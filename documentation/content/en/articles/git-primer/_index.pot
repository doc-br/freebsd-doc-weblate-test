"Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS), which means that the "
"entire repository, including all of the history, is maintained along with "
"each copy (clone). A developer makes changes to their local repository, then "
"shares those changes with other repositories. Git uses *fetch*, *pull*, and "
"*push* to refer to these sharing operations."

"In the DVCS model there are multiple repositories, each with their own view "
