"Usually the only option to support these kind of boards is to use a distinct "

"[.filename]#COM1# port (aka [.filename]#sio0#-I/O address 0x3F8 and IRQ 4) "
"and you have an extension board with two UARTs, you will commonly need to "
"configure them as [.filename]#COM2# (aka [.filename]#sio1#-I/O address 0x2F8 "
"and IRQ 3), and the third port (aka [.filename]#sio2#) as I/O 0x3E8 and IRQ "

"`COM_MULTIPORT` configuration described in the previous sections."
