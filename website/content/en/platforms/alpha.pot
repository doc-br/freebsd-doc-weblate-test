"As of FreeBSD 7.0, support for the Alpha platform has been removed. The "
"development of new Alpha systems has been discontinued by the hardware "
"vendor; this combined with the widespread deployment of more mainstream "
"64-bit platforms, such as the AMD64 and Intel EM64T architectures, has "
"resulted in significantly reduced user and developer community interest."
