"Over time, FreeBSD committers may find other demands on their time, and "
"decide that they wish to resign their commit bit. However, under some "
"circumstances, a committer may become inactive over a long period of time "
"without explicitly resigning their bit. Over the long term, these accounts "
"can represent a security risk, as well as posing procedural questions "
"regarding the degree to which contact information and access methods for the "
"account are maintainable. For these reasons, the FreeBSD Core Team approved "
"the following commit bit expiration policy, last updated on November 26, "
"2013."

"If all of a committer's commit bits expire, then the committer's "
"`FreeBSD.org` account may also be suspended at the FreeBSD Core Team's "
"discretion. An account is suspended by disabling login access and any other "
"services (such as CGI scripts or non-trivial mail forwarding configurations) "
"that execute under the committer's account. Simple mail forwarding will "
"continue to work, and an individual may e-mail `core@FreeBSD.org` to update "
"mail forwarding settings. The committer's files may or may not be preserved "
"at the FreeBSD Core Team's discretion. A suspended account will be "
"reactivated if any of a committer's commit bits are restored."
