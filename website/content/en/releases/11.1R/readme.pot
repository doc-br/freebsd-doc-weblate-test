"FreeBSD is an operating system based on 4.4 BSD Lite for AMD64 and Intel "
"EM64T based PC hardware (amd64), Intel, AMD, Cyrix or NexGen “x86” based PC "
"hardware (i386), NEC PC-9801/9821 series PCs and compatibles (pc98), and "
"UltraSPARC(R) machines (sparc64). Versions for the ARM(R) (arm), MIPS(R) "
"(mips), and PowerPC(R) (powerpc) architectures are currently under "
"development as well. FreeBSD works with a wide variety of peripherals and "
"configurations and can be used for everything from software development to "
"games to Internet Service Provision."

"This release of FreeBSD contains everything you need to run such a system, "

"A large collection of third-party ported software (the “Ports Collection”) "
"is also provided to make it easy to obtain and install all your favorite "
"traditional UNIX(R) utilities for FreeBSD. Each “port” consists of a set of "
"scripts to retrieve, configure, build, and install a piece of software, with "
"a single command. Over 24,000 ports, from editors to programming languages "
"to graphical applications, make FreeBSD a powerful and comprehensive "
"operating environment that extends far beyond what's provided by many "
"commercial versions of UNIX(R). Most ports are also available as "
"pre-compiled “packages”, which can be quickly installed from the "
"installation program."
