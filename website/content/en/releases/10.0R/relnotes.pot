"The zio nop-write improvement from Illumos was imported into FreeBSD. To "
"reduce I/O, nop-write skips overwriting data if the (cryptographically "
"secure) checksum of new data matches the checksum of existing data. It also "
"saves space if snapshots are in use. This improvement only works on datasets "
"with enabled compression, disabled deduplication and sha256 checksums. ZFS "
"will now compare the checksums of incoming writes to the checksum of the "
"existing on-disk data and avoid issuing any write I/O for data that has not "
"changed. This will reduce I/O as well as space usage because if the old "
"block is referenced by a snapshot, both copies of the block are kept even "
"though both contain the same "
"data. "
