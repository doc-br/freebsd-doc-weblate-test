"FreeBSD 2.1 represents the culmination of 6 months worth of work on the "
"2.1-STABLE branch of FreeBSD since the previous release (FreeBSD 2.0.5)."

"The STABLE branch was conceived out of the need to allow FreeBSD to grow and "
"support long-term development projects like devfs, NFSv3, IPX, PCCARD, "
"etc. while at the same time not jeopardizing the stability of its existing "
"user base. Experimental or high-impact changes are allowed into "
"https://www.freebsd.org/handbook/current.html[FreeBSD-current], which "
"represents a sort of shared group development tree, and only well tested or "
"obvious fixes are allowed into STABLE. In a few rare cases, where some bit "
"of functionality was entirely missing before, we've supplied an ALPHA test "
"quality version in STABLE on the premise that some functionality is better "
"than none at all (a good example being the IDE CDROM driver)."
