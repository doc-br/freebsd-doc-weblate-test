"FreeBSD is a freely available, full source 4.4 BSD Lite based release\n"
"for Intel i386/i486/Pentium (or compatible) based PC's.  It is based\n"

"Since our release of FreeBSD 2.0 over a year ago, the performance,\n"
"feature set and stability of FreeBSD has improved dramatically.  The\n"
"largest change is a revamped VM system with a merged VM/file buffer\n"
"cache that not only increases performance but reduces FreeBSD's memory\n"
"footprint, making a 5MB configuration a more acceptable minimum.\n"
"Other enhancements include full NIS client and server support,\n"
"transaction TCP support, dial-on-demand PPP, an improved SCSI\n"
"subsystem, early ISDN support, support for FDDI and Fast Ethernet\n"
"(100Mbit) adapters, improved support for the Adaptec 2940 (WIDE and\n"
"narrow) and 3940 SCSI adaptors along with many hundreds of bug fixes.\n"

"In addition to the base distributions, FreeBSD offers a new ported\n"
"software collection with over 350 commonly sought-after programs.  The\n"
"list of ports ranges from http (WWW) servers, to games, languages,\n"
"editors and almost everything in between.  The entire ports collection\n"
"requires only 10MB of storage, all ports being expressed as \"deltas\"\n"
"to their original sources.  This makes it much easier for us to update\n"
"ports and greatly reduces the disk space demands made by the ports\n"
"collection.  To compile a port, you simply change to the directory of\n"
"the program you wish to install, type make and let the system do the\n"
"rest.  The full original distribution for each port you build is\n"
"retrieved dynamically off of CDROM or a local ftp site, so you need\n"
"only enough disk space to build the ports you want.  (Almost) every\n"
"port is also provided as a pre-compiled \"package\" which can be\n"
"installed with a simple command (pkg_add).  See also the new Packages\n"
"option in the Configuration menu for an especially convenient interface\n"
