"Google Summer of Code is an exciting opportunity for students to \"intern\" "
"with an open source project for a summer. The FreeBSD Project, as one of the "
"most successful and oldest open source projects, is an excellent place to do "
"this internship. Founded in 1993, the project now consists of several "
"hundred \"committers\" and tens of thousands of contributors. FreeBSD is the "
"foundation for many commercial products, including Apple's Mac OS X, "
"NetApp's OnTap/GX, Juniper's JunOS, as well countless other products, and is "
"widely used in the Internet Service Provider and corporate IT worlds. Many "
"of these sponsors participate daily in the FreeBSD community, and students "
"have the opportunity to develop software ideas in an exciting environment "
"with many real world applications, and under the mentorship of experienced "
"developers."

"The FreeBSD Project maintains a "

"hacking, and have technical contacts who can help answer questions as you "

"https://wiki.FreeBSD.org/IdeasPage[Ideas Page]. These projects are less "
"suitable as Summer of Code projects as they may be scoped larger or smaller "
"than a summer, or might not have such a clear mentor - we suggest e-mailing "
"our soc-admins alias for help if you do decide to propose one of them. These "
"pages exist to help provide inspiration. Students are also welcome, and are "
