"While #freebsd channels exist on various IRC networks, the FreeBSD project "
"does not control them or endorse IRC as a support medium. You may be "
"ignored, insulted, or kicked out if you ask questions on any channel in IRC, "
"though you may have slightly better luck in channels named #freebsdhelp "
"where such exist. A list of known FreeBSD related IRC channels is available "
"in the FreeBSD https://wiki.freebsd.org/IRC/Channels[wiki]. If you want to "
"try these or any other channels on IRC, it is nonetheless at your own risk "
"and any complaints about conduct on those channels should not be directed to "
"the FreeBSD project. See also link:{faq}#irc[the FAQ entry] for more "
"information."
