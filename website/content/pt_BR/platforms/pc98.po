"FreeBSD/pc98 is a port of FreeBSD which aims to run on the NEC PC-98x1 "
"(pc98) architecture. The project's goal is to make FreeBSD/pc98 work the "
"same as FreeBSD on other architectures. Most of the kernel source is already "
"included in the FreeBSD source tree and most of the userland utilities built "
"from the source work fine."

"Although FreeBSD/pc98 was a Tier 1 for a long time since 5.0-RELEASE, it was "
"downgraded due to FreeBSD no longer supporting installation from floppy "
"disks, and most pc98 machines cannot boot from CD/DVD. Although later pc98 "
"machines can boot from CDROM, FreeBSD's support for that has not been "
"integrated into bsdinstall and release tools."
