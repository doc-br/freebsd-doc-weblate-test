#. The "Supported Devices" section of the release notes.
#. Generally processor-independent, with conditional text inclusion handling any architecture-dependent text.
#. Within each subsection describing a class of hardware (i.e. Ethernet interfaces), list broad groups of devices alphabetically as paragraphs sorted alphabetically (frequently these groups will be arranged by manufacturer, i.e. 3Com Ethernet interfaces).
#. Where applicable, a "Miscellaneous" section may follow all other named sections.
#. These guidelines are not hard-and-fast rules, and exceptions will occur. Following these guidelines (vague as they may be) is highly recommended to try to keep the formatting of this section consistent.
#. We give manpage references using the &man entities where possible. If a driver has no manpage (and consequently no man page, we simply give the name of the driver).
#. Please avoid doing man pages conversions unless you know for sure that an entity and manpage exist; sweeps through this file to fix "missed" conversions are likely to break the build.
