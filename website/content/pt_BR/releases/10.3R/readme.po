"FreeBSD is an operating system based on 4.4 BSD Lite for AMD64 and Intel "
"EM64T based PC hardware (amd64), Intel, AMD, Cyrix or NexGen \"x86\" based "
"PC hardware (i386), Intel Itanium Processor based computers (ia64), NEC "
"PC-9801/9821 series PCs and compatibles (pc98), and UltraSPARC(R) machines "
"(sparc64). Versions for the ARM(R) (arm), MIPS(R) (mips), and PowerPC(R) "
"(powerpc) architectures are currently under development as well. FreeBSD "
"works with a wide variety of peripherals and configurations and can be used "
"for everything from software development to games to Internet Service "

"This release of FreeBSD contains everything you need to run such a system, "

"A large collection of third-party ported software (the \"Ports Collection\") "

"traditional UNIX(R) utilities for FreeBSD. Each \"port\" consists of a set "
"of scripts to retrieve, configure, build, and install a piece of software, "
"with a single command. Over 24,000 ports, from editors to programming "
"languages to graphical applications, make FreeBSD a powerful and "
"comprehensive operating environment that extends far beyond what's provided "
"by many commercial versions of UNIX(R). Most ports are also available as "
"pre-compiled \"packages\", which can be quickly installed from the "
