"FreeBSD is an operating system based on 4.4 BSD Lite for AMD64 and Intel "
"EM64T based PC hardware (amd64), Intel, AMD, Cyrix or NexGen x86 based PC "
"hardware (i386), and UltraSPARC(R) machines (sparc64). Versions for the "
"ARM(R) (arm), MIPS(R) (mips), and PowerPC(R) (powerpc) architectures are "
"currently under development as well. FreeBSD works with a wide variety of "
"peripherals and configurations and can be used for everything from software "
"development to games to Internet Service Provision."

"This release of FreeBSD contains everything you need to run such a system, "
"including full source code for the kernel and all utilities in the base "

"A large collection of third-party ported software (the Ports Collection) is "
"also provided to make it easy to obtain and install all your favorite "
"traditional UNIX(R) utilities for FreeBSD. Each port consists of a set of "
"scripts to retrieve, configure, build, and install a piece of software, with "
"a single command. Over {numports} ports, from editors to programming "
"languages to graphical applications, make FreeBSD a powerful and "
"comprehensive operating environment that extends far beyond what's provided "
"by many commercial versions of UNIX(R). Most ports are also available as "
"pre-compiled packages, which can be quickly installed from the installation "
"program."
